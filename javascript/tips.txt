memoization

1. make it work
    *visualize the problem as a tree
    *implement the tree using recursion 
        *add base case first 
    *test it 

2.make it efficient 
    *add a memo object
        *as keys and values unique by the way 
        *object must be shared between them
    *add a new base case ti return memo values 
    *store return values into the memo
